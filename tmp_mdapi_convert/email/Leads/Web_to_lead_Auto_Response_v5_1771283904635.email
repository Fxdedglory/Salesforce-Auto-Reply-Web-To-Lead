<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi,<br />
<br />
This email is to notify you that you are now in my demo-CRM as a lead.<br />
<br />
I created a demo-CRM with a lead-generation tool in salesforce, then created this email response and attached a docusign to trigger whenever you filled out my form.<br />
<br />
Attached is a copy of my resume. You can schedule a meeting with me directly here:&nbsp;<a href="https://orgfarm-afa1697865-dev-ed.develop.my.salesforce-setup.com/servlet/servlet.ExternalRedirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalendly.com%2Fsellwood-timm%2F30min">https://calendly.com/sellwood-timm/30min</a><br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you soon,<br />
Tim Sellwood</body>
